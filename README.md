## Hide Correct Answers for Prarire Learn

### What does it do?

- Hides the correct answers on prarirelearn to allow better review.

- Lets you see the correct answers with a simple button press while reviewing the question.

- Lets you disable the extension by pressing the extension icon.

    - When the extension is disabled, no javascript will be sent to prarirelearn.

### What does it not do?

- It cannot show you the answers to questions you haven't already solved.

    - This includes questions that have multiple varients.

- If you solved a question incorrectly, it will hide your incorrect answer, but once you click "Show Correct Answers" the extension will only show your previous incorrect answer.

### TODO:

- [ ] Allow text input for for free response questions instead of hiding the entire box.

- [ ] Hide draggable proofs some way or another. Ideally the user to move around the proof blocks like the original question setup.
